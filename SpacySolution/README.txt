The main.py file depends on a number of different libraries to run correctly.
These libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file.

To quickly install the library necessary, use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(this may take some time as there are a lot of required files)

Most likely, this means that some form of python enviroment will be required to run this software -
I personally used pycharm for this, and so I atleast know this approach works.
